# QueenSwarm-Metaheuristic-PSO-Solver-for-N-Queens
This project uses Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a powerful metaheuristic algorithm, to solve the classic N-Queens problem. By simulating a swarm of particles searching the solution space, it efficiently minimizes conflicts and finds valid queen placements on the chessboard for varying board sizes.
